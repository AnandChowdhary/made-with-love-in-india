Founded in April 2013, the Made with Love in India initiative is a movement to celebrate, promote, and build a brand ‚Äî India.

On this website, you'll find a list of brands and products that are created in India and bear the **Made with Love in India** badge. These individuals and organizations promise to deliver the best-quality products to India and contribute to her growth.
