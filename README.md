# Made with Love in India
Founded in April 2013, the Made with Love in India initiative is a movement to celebrate, promote, and build a brand â€” India.

The initiative is based on the foundation that a small thing, a simple gesture, can brighten up someone's day and remind them that they should be proud of helping local entrepreneurs who contribute largely to the economy.

On this website, you'll find a list of brands and products that are created in India and bear the **Made with Love in India** badge. These individuals and organizations promise to deliver the best-quality products to India and contribute to her growth.

## You too?

Throw in a pull request with your website at the bottom of the list (don't worry, the list is randomized.)
